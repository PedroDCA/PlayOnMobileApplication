# PlayOnMobileApplication
 
Hi!
This project was made with the idea to create anykind of application that could be used on a actual real company, so I decided to create an inventory system application on mobile to learn about mobile application because I'd never worked on some mobile application and I wanted to see how it is. As it is a project for my university, it should be on spanish, it is the reason if you check the code you will find some Spanish words, I prefer to code in English at all but it was a decision that was not made by me.

To run it, you should have installed the "Mobile development with .NET" of Visual Studio 2019/2022.
